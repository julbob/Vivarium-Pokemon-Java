####Objective
This project was created as part of a course on object-oriented programming.<br>
Create an environment inhabited by different species who would interact with each other.<br>
The user should be able to place objects or new creatures on the map.

####Implementation
We choose to implement a universe that we knew well : Pokemon.<br>
Being born in the 1990's, we both grew with it, so when the idea of making a small world with species that didn't have to be simple insects or animal, we both thought about Pokemons.<br>
The only interactions we implemented between two creatures was the fight.<br>
The pokemon creatures offers a complex fighting system with a variety of types and a huge number of attacks.
