====== Vivarium Pokemon (in Java) ======
Developped by Nathan Olff and Julien Robert

This project was created as part of a course on object-oriented programming.

Objective :
Create an environment inhabited by different species who would interact with each other.
The user should be able to place objects or new creatures on the map.

Implementation :
We choose to implement a universe that we knew well : Pokemon.
Being born in the 1990's, we both grew with it, so when the idea of making a small world with species that didn't have to be simple insects or animal, we both thought about Pokemons.
The only interactions we implemented between two creatures was the fight.
The pokemon creatures offers a complex fighting system with a variety of types and a huge number of attacks.

Legal :
Pokemon is a media franchise owned by Nintendo.
